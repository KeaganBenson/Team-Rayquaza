DSC 180a Fall 2022 Flock Freight 

In this project, we will cover using methods to help optimal stopping for the acceptance and
reneging of delivery offers by carriers for Flock Freight’s orders. Time is money, and any time
spent being indecisive means loss of carrier clients. It is thus essential to provide a model and
process that is reliable and scalable to Flock Freight’s needs.
